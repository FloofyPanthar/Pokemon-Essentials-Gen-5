PokEssentials Gen 5 Alpha 8

FAQ:

    What exactly makes PokEssentials BW different from vanilla Pokémon Essentials
        There are a few significant differences, the most minor of these being
        the sprites and tilesets matching the style of Pokémon Black and White.
        The more useful differences are UI, Script, and Event changes to more
        easily create a game similar to the Pokémon games created in 2011 & 2012

    If all of these changes can be replicated in vanilla essentials, what is 
    even the point of downloading this modified version?
        That is true, all of the changes made in these games can be made within
        the confines of the orginial Pokémon Essentials. However, these changes
        are hard to make for beginners and can be very time consuming even for
        someone who is skilled with RMXP. I would recommend this pack to anybody
        who has the desire to create a fangame similar to BW/BW2 (Gen 5) since
        the hard work to convert the UI and mechanics from an HGSS/FRLG game has
        already been done.

    What is the point of making this when Klein's BW Pack already exists?   
        As great as Pokémon Essentials BW is, its creator, KleinStudios has been
        quite inactive in the Pokémon fangame community. There is no way of knowing
        whether or not he will update his project or even his add on scripts.
        The lastest verson of his project, v3.1.1, released over 3 years ago,
        has code reminants from version 15! Therefore, the project is reletively
        buggy and works quite poorly with some of our community's newest scripts.

    Wait... are these fangames illegal?
        I don't know, I don't care. I believe that fans should be able to have
        the power to make fangames without having to fear legal action.
        I believe that we should never stop doing what we love because of 
        corporate greed.

    The game constantly keeps on telling me to install the fonts, what the heck 
    does this mean and how do I do it?"
        There is a font folder included in essentials, take the files in there
        and drag them into your computers font folder.

    Why aren't some of the keys working?
        PEG5 has different controls than you may be use to, but the controls are
        more intuitive than regular Essentials. Every button is pressed by its
        corresponding key: A->A, B->B, etc. There are a few exceptions though;
        Shift can be used for to run, as most Essentials fans are accustomed to it,
        And Start and Select, which don't exist on a keyboard, are controled by
        the Enter and Shift keys respectively
